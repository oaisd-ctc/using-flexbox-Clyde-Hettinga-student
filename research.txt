Container properties:

    flex-direction determines what direction the flex items are displayed
        column stacks them vertically top-to-bottom
        column-reverse stacks them vertically bottom-to-top
        row (not listed in the code) stacks them horizontally left-to-right
        row-reverse stacks them horizontally right-to-left

    justify-content aligns flex items horizontally
        center aligns them at the center of the container
        flex-start (not listed in the code) aligns them at the start of the container
        flex-end aligns them at the end of the container
        space-around displays them with space before, between, and after the lines
        space-between displays them with space between the lines

    align-items aligns flex items vertically
        center aligns them in the middle of the container
        flex-start aligns them at the top of the container
        flex-end aligns them at the bottom of the container
        stretch (not listed in the code) stretches them to fill the container
        baseline aligns them so that their text baselines align

Item properties:

    order specifies what order to display a flex item and requires a number value

    flex is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis, all of which determine the item's length

Pseudo-classes:

    :active styles an element (not just links!) only when it's clicked

    :first-child selects every one of that element that is the first child of its parent
    
    :hover styles an element only when the mouse is overtop it
    
    :not(selector) selects every one of that element except for the one in the parentheses

    :nth-child(n) selects every element that is the nth child of its parent
        n can a number, keyword (odd/even) or formula (e.g. an + b)

-----

I didn't know where to put this one, so here it is by itself

    transition is another shorthand property, combining transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay
        I only specified the transition-duration part of this property
